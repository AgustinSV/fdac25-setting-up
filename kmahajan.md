I am Kavita Mahajan, a first year Phd student in Data Science and Engineering (DSE) at Bredesen Center. I did a small project with collaborators at ORNL, where we used machine learning as a black box to predict rainfall over the Amazon basin from tropical ocean surface temperatures. For the project, we used both numerical model data and observational data, which were provided by others. It became clear to me that preparing such datasets is not a trivial task. I would like to learn more about what goes into gathering, creating and preparing such datasets for research.
