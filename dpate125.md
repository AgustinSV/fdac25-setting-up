Hi, I am Deep Patel. I am a Senior in Computer Science and have minors in Machine Learning and Data Science. I am from Winchester, Tn. I am interested in how data science and machine learning techniques can tell us more about the hidden knowledge available all around us.Through this course, I am mostly interested in how to use data science to obtain and curate data to make it possible to use machine learning methods on it.
