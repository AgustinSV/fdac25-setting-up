I am Cole Price and I am a senior in Computer Science. I have just finished up an internship at SailPoint as a Software Engineer Intern. I enjoy coding with a focus on backend dev and also enjoy playing pickleball. I hope that I will learn some things in this course about acquiring the correct data and cleaning data that will help me grow as a developer.
