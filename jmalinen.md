Hi everyone,
My name is Jashikar and I am a Graduate Student getting my Master's degree in Computer Science and this is my 2nd year. My interests are in Cybersecurity and ML Models. I have taken this course because in order to get a 
good model you need to have a good data set. I want to know how to find good data sets and how to make a dataset good and useful. I am planning on building a ML model using NLP or CNN or LSTM. For this we need to have a good dataset.
