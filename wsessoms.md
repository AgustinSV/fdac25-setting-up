I am Will Sessoms, and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in cybersecurity. I've lived in Knoxville for over a decade now, and I enjoy watching sports and listening to music. I'm looking forward to learning more about how we collect large amounts of data and clean it to make the data more useful.
